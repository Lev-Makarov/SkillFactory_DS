### Project Overview
Trying to guess the number in minimum tries

### Problem
To write a program which guesses the number in minimum tries, at least less than 20
* Computer gets the number in range 1 to 100. 
* algorythm should find this number


Quality metrics
Result of algorythm is mean fo tries in 1000 steps cycle


### Data


### Project stages
tried 2 algorythms:
    random number, mean number of tries to guess the number is 101
    power 2 algorythm, mean number of tries to guess the number is 5

### Result


### Conclusion
power 2 algorythm works 20 times better than random algorythm
